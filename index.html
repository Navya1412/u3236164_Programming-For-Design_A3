            <p class="para"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19"> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</a> is a contagious disease caused by a virus, the severe 
                acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified
                in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in the
                COVID-19 pandemic. Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, 
                headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Symptoms may             begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are 
                infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe air contaminated
                by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus

                        If you have had COVID-19 you should wait to be vaccinated with your next COVID-19 vaccine,
                        either primary course or booster doses,  3 months after the confirmed infection. This is to
                        optimise your vaccine protection. A longer gap between infection and vaccination is likely
                        to lead to a better immune response and result in longer protection from reinfection. The
                        next scheduled dose of COVID-19 vaccine should be given as soon as possible after 3 months.
                        You should still have all the recommended doses for your age group or individual health needs.
                        If you have had COVID-19, you do not need to defer other vaccinations – for example, your flu
                        vaccine. But you should not get any vaccine if you are acutely unwell (e.g., you have a fever).

                        Autoimmune diseases, such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis, are chronic (long-term)
                        illnesses where our immune systems attack our own cells. There is no evidence to suggest 
                        that COVID-19 vaccines can cause autoimmune diseases. Learn more about the <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/who-can-get-vaccinatedCOVID-19">vaccines

            <button type="button" class="collapse">Do COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility?</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p class="ans">
                    There is no scientific evidence to support this. None of the <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-progr%C3%A4ms/covid-19-vaccines">COVID-19 vaccines</a> currently 
                    under review by the <a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/">Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)</a> cause sterilisation/infertility.
                    The TGA will not approve a vaccine for use in Australia unless it is <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/approved-vaccines/safety-side-effects">safe and effective</a>.
                    This includes impacts on fertility. The theory that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility is
                    based on the disproven idea that one of the spike proteins in COVID-19 and the Syncytin-1
                    protein (which help placenta development) are the same. They are not. The COVID-19 vaccine,
                    like other vaccines, works by training our bodies to develop antibodies to fight against the
                    virus that causes COVID-19, to prevent future illness. There is currently no evidence that
                    antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy, including the
                    development of the placenta. In addition, there is no evidence suggesting that fertility
                    problems are a side effect of ANY vaccine. People who are trying to become pregnant now
                    or who plan to try in the future may receive the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available
                    to them.

                        the right to choose whether to be vaccinated or not – but it is recommended for the strong
                        protection it provides against severe illness and death. There may be circumstances in which
                        proof of vaccination is required, such as continued employment in particular areas. One
                        example of this is the mandatory vaccination requirements for all residential aged care
                        workers which came into effect on 17 September 2021 in line with relevant state and territory
                        directions.

                    <p class="ans">
                        It is not recommended to take over the counter medicine before receiving a vaccination for
                        the purpose of preventing potential side effects. You should continue to take prescribed
                        medication unless advised by your medical practitioner. Always discuss any existing medical
                        conditions with your doctor or pharmacist before you get any vaccine. To date, <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/committees-and-groups/australian-technical-advisory-group-on-immunisation-atagi">the Australian
                        Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI)</a> have not found any specific biological risk

                <div class="content">
                    <p class="ans">
                        It is not yet known how long the protection of the <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/approved-vaccines">COVID-19 vaccine</a> will last. We will know
                        more through ongoing research. Clinical trials are currently happening to find out if we
                        will need booster doses on an annual or longer basis. What we do know is that evidence shows
                        that all of the COVID-19 vaccines approved for use In Australia   prevent severe disease,
                        people going to hospital and dying. Protection against getting infected does appear to wane
                        over time. Protection against death and severe disease also drops over time, but more slowly.
                        You can increase your protection by getting a booster from 3 months after your primary course.
                        An additional booster dose, or ‘fourth dose’, is recommended for people aged 50 years and older,
                        people living in residential care, or people with a underlying health condition or disability.
                        People aged 30 to 49 years old can also receive a fourth dose if they choose. The additional
                        booster is the fifth dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for eligible people who are severely
                        immunocompromised.
